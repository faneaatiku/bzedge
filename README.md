### Checkout latest releases here: https://github.com/bze-alphateam/bzedge/releases


# BZEdge
**Keep running wallet to strengthen the BZEdge network. Backup your wallet in many locations & keep your coins wallet offline. Copy your BitcoinZ walet into BZEdge folder. BitcoinZ funds before 17 June 2018 will be duplicated on BZEdge. Replay protection: Send entire amount in each transparent address to a new address (including the free 0.1BZE). Those coins will be replay protected. To protect Z funds from replay, send your "protected" coin to the Z address, then the whole balance in one transaction to the next address.**

### Ports:
- RPC port: 1980
- P2P port: 1990
